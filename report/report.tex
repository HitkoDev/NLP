\section*{Introduction}

The field of recognising the content and structure of texts and extracting content from them is increasingly related to machine learning methods. Not only syntax checking but also pure understanding of texts by humans is interesting for machine learning for different motives. There is practically no more field related to language that in some way could not be linked to machine learning methods.



%These latex files are intended to serve as a the template for the FRI Data Science Project Competition. If you find mistakes in the template or have problems using it, please consult Jure Demšar (\href{mailto:jure.demsar@fri.uni-lj.si}{jure.demsar@fri.uni-lj.si}).

%In the Introduction section you should write about the relevance of your work (what is the purpose of the project, what will we solve) and about related work (what solutions for the problem already exist). Where appropriate, reference scientific work conducted by other researchers. For example, the work done by Demšar et al. \cite{Demsar2016BalancedMixture} is very important for our project. The abbreviation et al. is for et alia, which in latin means and others, we use this abbreviation when there are more than two authors of the work we are citing. If there are two authors (or if there is a single author) we just write down their surnames. For example, the work done by Demšar and Lebar Bajec \cite{Demsar2017LinguisticEvolution} is also important for successful completion of our project.

\section*{Related Work}

J. Leng and P. Jiang explored relationship extraction using a deep learning approach to help support decision making in a social manufacturing context. This paper focused on creating a deep learning model that is based on an improved stacked denoising auto-encoder on sentence-level features. This models extracts manufacturing relationships, named entities, and text-based contexts. Their results reveal that this approach produces similar performance with the latest learning models.~\cite{leng2016deep}

C. Giles and J. Wren developed an SVM classifier using NLP-based approaches to extract relationships between entities such as genes, chemicals, metabolites, phenotypes, and diseases. The classifier would label what kind of relationship there is between two entities such as positive or negative, then detect what type of semantic relationship they have such as binds, cleaves, etc. The main goal of this paper was to get the highest accuracy possible to prevent contradictions, but some inaccuracy was expected. SVM cross validation showed that the implementation had a good F1 score at 88\%.~\cite{giles2008large}

A. Roberts el al. worked on a supervised machine learning system (SVM) which was trained on a corpus of patient narratives which were manually annotated with clinical relationships. To evaluate the model, a standard ten-fold cross validation methodology and standard evaluation metrics were used. This resulted in an F1 score of 75\% The paper concluded that it is possible to extract (clinical) relationships from text using an SVM with shallow features. ~\cite{roberts2008extracting}

V. Devisree and PC. Reghu Raj combined the unsupervised and supervised approaches to create a hybrid model that is able to extract relationships from stories. The model identifies the main characters, collects sentences that relate to them, then these sentences are analyzed, and finally, the relationship between the characters is classified. Whilst training if the sentence is classified, then it goes through the supervised section of the model and if it's unclassified, it goes through the unsupervised section of the model.l The corpus used was a set of 100 short stories for kids, which contained multiple different relationship types. Three relationship categories were used; Parent-Child, Friendship, No-Relation, The hybrid model managed to achieve an F1 score of 83\%  ~\cite{devisree2016hybrid}

\section*{Methods}

In the group, we decided to try to analyse different short stories to extract information about the characters who appear in the texts and to find out what kind of relationships these characters are in.

First, we found a collection of English short stories and chose a subset of them for training. Then, in the python programming language, we will use libraries such as NLTK, SpaCy, SNER, GATE... to determine which characters appear in the stories. At this stage, it will be necessary to extract the characters' actual names from the text and ensure that the correct numbers of characters and their positions in the text are extracted.

In the second part, we will try to make a model that properly connects characters in pairs into family relations. The model should determine whether a couple of characters are in a family relationship and, if so, then determine the type of relation. Due to the complexity of the task, we decided not to classify relations which are not family-related. We think that discovering family relations is a complex enough task.

As part of the task, we will review the models that have already been implemented and, based on the results of the solutions already made, make our own model that would classify as accurately as possible.


%Use the Methods section to describe what you did an how you did it -- in what way did you prepare the data, what algorithms did you use, how did you test various solutions ... Provide all the required details for a reproduction of your work.

%Below are \LaTeX examples of some common elements that you will probably need when writing your report (e.g. figures, equations, lists, code examples ...).

\section*{Existing solutions}

The use of deep neural networks is on the rise in already implemented solutions, but other approaches and combinations of these are also used in models for classifying family relations between persons in the text, such as rule-based approaches, utterance attribution and vocative detection technique and unsupervised approach to the extraction of interpersonal relations are described in the articles, which we intend to take as a basis for further work.

\section*{Relations}

We decided to check if the following relations occur between the character in short stories:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
\item Wife
\item Husband
\item Mother
\item Father
\item Daughter
\item Son
\item Sister
\item Brother
\item Grandmother
\item Grandfather
\item Granddaughter
\item Grandson
\item Mother-in-law
\item Father-in-law
\item Daughter-in-law
\item Son-in-law
\item Sister-in-law
\item Brother-in-law
\item Aunt
\item Uncle
\item Niece
\item Nephew
\item Cousin
\end{itemize}

Those are the broadest family relations we intend to use. We expect that there will be no need to add new relationships. If the model proves to be too large for our task, some relations can be removed from the model.

\section*{Model}

For extracting and classification family relatins in short stories, we are considering two models: CasRel~\cite{wei2020CasRel} and DocuNetl~\cite{ijcai2021-551}.

CasRel is sentence oriented. That means that in the first step model discovers identities and in the second step applies relation-specific taggers to identify all possible relations and the corresponding object simultaneously. Relations are represented with relational triples (subject, relation, object). The model takes all subjects in a sentence and, for each subject, iterates through relations and tries to find the object which is in a known relation with the subject. The model implements a more holistic approach to relation classification than usual, and, according to article~\cite{wei2020CasRel}, it achieved high accuracy on NYT and WebNLG datasets.

On the other hand, DocuNET (Document U-shaped Network) is document-oriented. That means the model tries to find relations between entities over the whole document. According to the article~\cite{ijcai2021-551}, above \numprint{40.7}\% of relations can only be identified at the document level, and this model is the first that implements relation extraction as semantic segmentation. The approach is similar to computer vision, where each pixel is classified into one visual object. On the same principle, DocuNET tries to classify two entities into one of the known relations.

We think that the second model would be more appropriate for our task because of the document level orientation. However, we're trying to use the first model to aid in annotating the data in preparation for training the final model since annotating all the data by hand would take a lot of time and effort.


%\subsection*{Equations}

% You can write equations inline, e.g. $\cos\pi=-1$, $E = m \cdot c^2$ and $\alpha$, or you can include them as separate objects. The Bayes’s rule is stated mathematically as:

% \begin{equation}
%     P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)},
%     \label{eq:bayes}
% \end{equation}

% where $A$ and $B$ are some events. You can also reference it -- the equation \ref{eq:bayes} describes the Bayes's rule.

% \subsection*{Lists}

% We can insert numbered and bullet lists:

% the [noitemsep] option makes the list more compact
% \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
%     \item First item in the list.
%     \item Second item in the list.
%     \item Third item in the list.
% \end{enumerate}

% \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
%     \item First item in the list.
%     \item Second item in the list.
%     \item Third item in the list.
% \end{itemize}

% We can use the description environment to define or describe key terms and phrases.

% \begin{description}
%     \item[Word] What is a word?.
%     \item[Concept] What is a concept?
%     \item[Idea] What is an idea?
% \end{description}
