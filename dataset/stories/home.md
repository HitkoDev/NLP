“Tip-top drip-drop,” I sing with the rain,
jumping over puddles on my way home
from school. The crinkly metal sheets
covering the houses in our village sing
along: “Tip-tip-drop
drip-drip-top.”

I love the rain! But sometimes I completely
disapprove of it. It’s not as bad as beetroot, but I
get annoyed when the sky can’t decide if it’s
happy or sad. “Again?” I complain to the clouds.
Again, the clouds send down a neverending
river of droplets.

Dada says our family has lived in this village, Feizung, since
the grandparents of the great-grandparents of the greatgreat-grandparents of our great-great-greatgrandparents! That is more than three hundred years.
We make scarves and shawls, each one special. But I love
most the shawls that Dada makes. They are so big and
soft—I sleep with one of his shawls curled under my arms.

Amma weaves words
instead of threads. She is the
most theatrical storyteller in
the whole village—unlike
Abbu, who tells stories at the
pace of an old tortoise.
Our village is surrounded by
rice fields—lush, green and
vast—with homes made of
bamboo scattered like stars
in the sky.

Our country is big, but we are
not allowed everywhere.
Amma says we can only go to
places where people look like
us. Luckily, the village has
everything I need—my
family, my friends, and fields
to play in. The only thing we
lack is a doctor.

5/16

Which is why, when I begin sneezing
more times than a train choo-choos,
Amma takes me to a doctor in the
village two hours away. As we prepare
to leave the clinic, I hear the masjid’s
loudspeaker. But instead of singing, the
imam is shouting.

“Run west. Everyone, run west. Run with what you have in hand. Don’t
go home. There is no time. Armed men are coming towards us and
burning everything they pass. We are afraid they may kill anyone who
crosses their path. Run west. Run!” The imam sounds terrified.

6/16

All I have in my hand is
Amma’s hand and all I
can do is to hold it tight.
Everyone else is holding
something or carrying
someone.

7/16

And so, we run. We run west, with hundreds of other people.
Just like many droplets create a river, we form a river flowing west.
Each droplet is a person walking, running, stumbling.
This neverending river crosses rice fields, orchards, forests and hills.
New droplets join. Many are lost along the way.

But the droplets I want most—Abbu, Dada, Mami, the rest of our
family—never join the river.

8/16

The people-river crosses what Amma says is a
border. She says we are in a new country now.
But everything looks the same.

Do rivers know they have crossed borders? Do
they even know what borders are?

9/16

We are in an open, and barren field.

On one horizon, rice fields fade into where our
home was. On the other horizon, a town fades
into the ocean.

10/16

The empty field slowly fills up with
tents and huts.
Food is not grown here. People give it
to us. Water does not come from
wells. It arrives in trucks.

11/16

Amma says we are safe
here. But what about
Abbu, Dada and Mami?
Are they safe?
I look and look all
around me. Safety
seems to have become
an open field inside
an invisible bubble.

Here, we are all living in
the hope of going home,
some day.
Is it even possible to feel
safe without a home?
Safe, without my family
and friends?

12/16

I often wonder, where is home?
Is it here? Or is it where my family is?
Can home be in two places?
A part of my heart will
always be in Feizung. But is
it still home if we never go
back to it?

13/16

School starts. Two years pass. Abbu,
Dada, Mami and everyone I love never
come.
Amma and I are still here. We are told
we cannot leave this camp. But
everyone also keeps saying we can’t
stay forever.
On one side there is still the road to
Feizung. On the other, the ocean.
Sometimes we think of escaping. But
today, I have school.

14/16

“Hasina, did you cover the books in
plastic?” Amma shouts as I hurry off to
school in the rain.
“Yes, Amma, I did,” I yell back, trying to be
louder than the crinkly plastic sheets that
sing, “Tip-tip-drop
drip-drip-top.”
