# Literacy situation models knowledge base creation

Building a knowledge base based on situation models from selected English/Slovene short stories. Knowledge base can focus on a subset of the following inference types: Referential, Case structure role  assignment, Causal antecedent, Superordinate goal, Thematic, Character emotional reaction, Causal consequence, Instantiation of noun category, Instrument, Subordinate goal, State, Emotion of reader, Author's intent.

Description: Extraction of concepts/entities/relationships/topics/time-aware data from novels. Creation of a book knowledge base and methods for inference and visualization (e.g. main characters, good/bad characters, "dramski trikotnik" (story grammar), time and space analysis, ...)

## Task:

1.  selection and retrieval of additional books (EN/SL) - 7 English provided, 
2.  review and detailed proposal of analysis to be done, 
3.  analysis with evaluations, explanations from narrative texts/stories, for example: causal chain summaries.
